## Connect Four

I decided make something fun, and also try MVC. So I think that this game fits to me. Game that I did is working in the browser only but, in my mind I will change it soon. So if you want to relax or to check you mathematical skills(bacause this game have strategy that you can`t lose) you can use it.

# MVC(What is it?)

MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a pattern in software design commonly used to implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic. It emphasizes a separation between the softwareâ€™s business logic and display. This "separation of concerns" provides for a better division of labor and improved maintenance. Some other design patterns are based on MVC, such as MVVM (Model-View-Viewmodel), MVP (Model-View-Presenter), and MVW (Model-View-Whatever).

The three parts of the MVC software-design pattern can be described as follows:

1. Model: Manages data and business logic.
2. View: Handles layout and display.
3. Controller: Routes commands to the model and view parts.

# Connect four:

Connect Four (also known as Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Captain's Mistress, Four in a Row, Drop Four, and Gravitrips in the Soviet Union) is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Connect Four is a solved game.
